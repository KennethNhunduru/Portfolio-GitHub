## CarInsurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes a user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic.
There is also an Admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. This project was an example of how to use ViewModels to limit the information avaiable to a prticular class of user.

## Entity Framework Code-First Database
This project showcases the creation of a basic Entity Framework Code-First console application that creates a basic Student database and adds one student. An Admin page is included which shows only the information of interest to the administrators. 

## Basic Approval Program for Car Insurance
This project requests information from a user to apply in the business logic for determining whether the user qualifies for Car Insurance or not.

## Shipping Quote for a Package
This project estimates the price for shipping a package based on package dimensions and weight enlisted from the user. This is just a basic application that does not take into account the shipping distance. However it does take into account shipping constraints on the weight and dimensions of the package.
